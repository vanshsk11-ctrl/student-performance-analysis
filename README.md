#  Student Performance Data Analysis & Visualization

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes factors influencing student academic performance using data analysis and visualization techniques. The goal is to examine how study habits, prior academic achievement, sleep patterns, and practice behavior relate to overall performance, and to present insights through clear visualizations.

##  Dataset
The dataset contains student-level academic and lifestyle information used to evaluate performance outcomes.

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and is publicly available for educational and analytical purposes.

Source: Kaggle – Student Performance Dataset

### Key Variables:
- **Hours Studied** – Average number of hours spent studying
- **Previous Scores** – Prior academic performance
- **Sleep Hours** – Average hours of sleep per day
- **Sample Question Papers Practiced** – Number of practice exams completed
- **Extracurricular Activities** – Participation in extracurricular activities (Yes/No)
- **Performance Index** – Final academic performance metric (target variable)

## Procedure
1. Loaded and inspected the dataset for structure and completeness
2. Cleaned and prepared numerical and categorical variables
3. Explored relationships between academic and lifestyle factors
4. Created data visualizations to highlight trends and patterns and help interpret the data
5. Interpreted results to understand insights

##  Key Insights
- Previous academic scores showed the strongest relationship with final performance
- Increased study hours and practicing sample question papers were associated with higher performance
- Adequate sleep supported improved academic outcomes
- Extracurricular activities showed a statistically significant increase, however the effect size is small, suggesting a limited practical impact
